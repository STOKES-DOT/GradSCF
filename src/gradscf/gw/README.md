# Molecular GW controls

```python
from gradscf import gto, scf, gw, bse

mf = scf.RHF(gto.M(atom='H 0 0 0; H 0 0 .74', basis='sto-3g')).run()
mygw = gw.GW(mf, method='evgw0', nw=100,
            max_cycle=80, conv_tol=1e-9).run()
print(mygw.mo_energy)             # Ha
print(mygw.result.qp_weight)      # local frequency derivative, dimensionless
response = bse.BSE(mygw, nroots=1, tda=False).run()
```

The restricted facade supports `g0w0`, `evgw` and `evgw0`. The latter two
reuse the existing eigenvalue fixed-point loop. `evgw0` fixes the original
mean-field spectrum in W while updating G; `evgw` updates both. Orbitals and
mean-field exchange subtraction stay fixed. W0 is built once per evGW0 call
and reused across its outer iterations. `max_cycle`,
`conv_tol` and `damp` configure only the outer eigenvalue loop. Functional
molecular drivers accept `differentiation=SCFDifferentiationConfig()` for
[outer implicit JVP/VJP](OUTER_RESPONSE.md); an inner implicit QP derivative
is not its substitute. `UGW` offers the same three forward method choices
for HF references; its W0 arrays are currently recomputed with fixed spectra.

## Three independent windows

- `run(orbs=...)`: which QP levels to correct; others keep their MF values.
- `g_orbitals=...`: intermediate orbitals in the correlation Green's function.
- `screening_occupied=...` and `screening_virtual=...`: transitions in W.

Indices are zero-based original MO indices, not renumbered active-space
indices. `None` means all allowed indices; an empty tuple removes the
corresponding correlation sum. These windows do not truncate mean-field J/K
or change electron count. All bare MO factors are still formed and stored.
Changing the optical window later in BSE does not alter W.

For example, excluding the first doubly occupied core orbital from G and W
uses `g_orbitals=range(1,nmo)` and `screening_occupied=range(1,nocc)`.
Explicit windows avoid element-dependent implicit frozen-core rules.

The restricted low-level `g0w0_cd_restricted` takes the same windows plus an
independent `screening_energy` spectrum. Its default is the existing G pole
spectrum, preserving older calls. `evgw_cd_restricted(update_w=False)` exposes
the fixed-W variant without another iteration implementation. These additions
currently target the real closed-shell molecular route; unrestricted/periodic
window controls and new self-consistency methods are not implied.

## Quasiparticle diagnostics and provenance

`GWResult` records QP energies, self-energy, residuals, computed/converged masks,
W energies, original-MO correlation windows and the producing method.
`qp_weight = 1/(1-d Re Sigma/d omega)` is evaluated at returned energies with
G/W fixed. Unrequested levels and singular slopes have NaN weights. A finite
weight does not certify root convergence or guarantee a physical main peak;
negative weights are not clipped. This is not a multi-root search or an
automatic largest-weight satellite-selection algorithm.

The native BSE adapter inherits the actual W spectrum and windows. G0W0/evGW0
therefore give W0; converged evGW supplies its updated W. Missing legacy
metadata retains the prior explicit-reference rules. Cached GW/BSE properties
are invalidated by source/settings changes; failed GW reruns clear their result.

The QP implicit VJP and fixed-input G0W0/BSE derivatives retain their existing
contracts. See [BSE properties](../bse/README.md), [scGW](SCGW.md), and
[executed MolGW comparisons](../bse/VALIDATION.md). COHSEX, spin-flip BSE,
periodic BSE, analytic continuation of scGW, and distributed execution remain
outside this increment.

## Algorithm references

Window separation and fixed-W iteration were checked against MolGW 3.4 source
revision `b831818d7a845c36f295d036dc8ceef59daf9991`:

GradSCF retains its JAX contour-deformation implementation and shared solvers.
The executable comparison uses MolGW's independent analytic spectral route;
its graphical QP weights require a separate frequency-grid convergence check.


## Optional QP forward solvers

`GW(mf, qp_solver='newton')` and `GW(mf, qp_solver='hybrid')` use AD frequency
slopes for the inner G0W0 root calculation. `UGW` accepts the same choice.
The default remains secant; the measured small CPU cases do not show a speedup.
Forward method selection does not change the implicit backward. See
[algorithms, safeguards and measured costs](QP_SOLVERS.md).


## Molecular contour-boundary treatment

Molecular diagonal G0W0/evGW/evGW0 self-energies now subtract Wc(0) from the
imaginary-axis quadrature and residue, then add the analytic static term.
This is essential when evGW evaluates omega exactly at a G pole: a strict
residue mask alone drops its half-residue contribution. Explicit per-spin
occupation signs also cover empty/full molecular spin channels. The formula
and independent single-pole/parameter-response checks are described in the
[expanded MolGW validation](../bse/VALIDATION.md).

The imaginary Green denominator uses eta->0; `eta` still broadens real-frequency
W. At finite eta this differs from the previous Green-broadened quadrature,
and is not a proof of exact boundary continuity or arbitrary higher AD.
Periodic q0 head/wing paths retain their previous convention. Molecular matrix
qsGW uses the corresponding static subtraction, with an independent analytic
two-orbital pole test; this does not establish full qsGW parity with MolGW.


For one contracted intermediate state, let delta = omega - epsilon_m,
s = -1 (occupied) or +1 (virtual), and W0 = Wc(0). The regularized expression is

```
Sigma_m = -1/pi * integral_0^infinity
              delta/(delta**2 + nu**2) * [Wc(i*nu) - W0] dnu
          + s/2 * W0
          + (sign(delta)+s)/2 * [Wc(abs(delta)) - W0].
```

At zero real-axis broadening, Wc(i*nu)-W0 is O(nu^2). The subtracted
imaginary-axis integral and its first frequency derivative are regular at
delta=0. The residue coefficient is s/2 on that boundary. At finite eta,
the existing real-frequency response convention does not give exactly the
same Wc(0) as the imaginary-axis evaluation, so this identity is exact in
the eta->0 limit. Quadrature convergence remains necessary, including the
subtracted large-frequency tail.

## Molecular evGW resolvent acceleration

The restricted molecular evGW/evGW0 loop uses a direct-RPA transition-space resolvent.
For occupied-virtual factors V and positive gaps Delta, define

```
T = V sqrt(Delta)
M = diag(Delta**2) + 4 T.T T
G = T.T B_mn
Wc(z)[mn] = -4 G_mn.T (M - z**2 I)^-1 G_mn
```

The MO-pair contractions above are the diagonal of the pair-space quadratic
form. On the imaginary axis use z=i*nu and real gaps. To retain the existing
real-axis response, 1/(omega-Delta+2i*eta)+1/(-omega-Delta), construct a second
model with Delta replaced by Delta-i*eta and evaluate it at z=omega+i*eta.
Using the real matrix at z=omega+i*eta alone would change the finite-eta
response, particularly near a screening pole. The reference pole helpers use
that simpler convention only for checks; production preserves the CD response.

The shared `solvers.linear.factor_shifted` / `solve_shifted` implementation
reuses the real symmetric imaginary-axis factorization and a complex symmetric
real-axis factorization for many shifts. A defective or poorly conditioned
complex eigenbasis falls back to a dense solve. Spectral factors are stopped
primal data, while `custom_linear_solve` differentiates

```
(M-shift*I) dx = db - (dM-dshift*I) x.
```

Thus physical matrix, coupling, frequency and eta derivatives are retained;
no division by an eigenvalue gap is needed at degeneracy. Singular shifted
systems remain outside this derivative contract; no denominator clipping is
introduced. This combines the speed of a spectral solve with a basis-invariant
matrix-equation derivative, rather than treating spectral speed and correct
AD as mutually exclusive choices.

Residue evaluation requests only the external/intermediate MO pairs it needs,
including nonconsecutive G windows. evGW0 reuses both the factorization and the
imaginary-axis/static W values within one invocation. There is no global cache.
G0W0 still defaults to CD. Molecular evGW/evGW0 and restricted qsGW offer
opt-in [outer implicit response](OUTER_RESPONSE.md); eager forward remains default.

A serial C3H6/STO-3G/Weigend-RI comparison with 64 quadrature points tested
reused factorization against a per-frequency dense reference. Both sides of
the benchmark now retain the same finite-eta CD response. First-call results,
repeat samples, settings and timing boundaries are recorded in
[the benchmark report](../../../reproducibility/gw_bse/cycloalkane_scaling/resolvent_reuse.md).


## Fixed-phonon matrix scGW

`scgw_matsubara_restricted(..., phonons=PhononModel(...))` adds an external
harmonic Fan/Debye-Waller model inside each electronic iteration. The model
uses the fixed initial orthonormal MO frame; its frequencies and vertices
remain differentiable external parameters. The shared implicit root includes
the dynamic self-energy, total tail moment, static DW potential and particle
number. See [ep_coupling](ep_coupling/README.md) for conventions and boundaries.

With a phonon model, `total_energy` is None; `electronic_energy` is explicitly
only the electronic contribution, excluding nuclear repulsion and EP/phonon
energies. Fixed phonons do not imply a self-consistent phonon Dyson equation.
Complex periodic Fan kernels now include the Matsubara reference correction
and high-frequency moment; they are numerical maps, not a periodic scGW driver.
Direct fixed-reference retarded Fan, on-shell linewidths and matrix spectral
functions are also available; these do not analytically continue scGW output. An executable native H2 demonstration is in
[fixed_phonon_scgw.py](../../../examples/gw/fixed_phonon_scgw.py).
