   Equations 17–23 define the static kernel, singlet/triplet factors and
   transition-space integral ordering used here.

   GW/RPA screening context; the auxiliary-factor convention also follows the
   existing GradSCF GW module documentation.
3. [QuAcK](https://github.com/pfloos/QuAcK), commit
   `2236bfcda24ff0971358f5107636b506dd201bb1` (2026-09-02).
   The unmodified Fortran routines `phRLR_A.f90` and
   `RGW_phBSE_static_kernel_A.f90` were compiled and run as an external oracle.
   QuAcK's KA is a **screening correction**, not full W or the complete BSE A.
   Independent NumPy full direct-RPA poles and excitation densities supply its
   input. Adding its bare resonant block and KA is compared with GradSCF's
   auxiliary-inverse formulation. Source hashes, compiler and commands are in
   `tests/bse/data/quack_static_seed83.json`.
4. [MOLGW BSE tutorial](https://www.molgw.org/tuto_bse/) and
   [VOTCA-XTP architecture](https://www.votca.org/xtp/Architecture.html).
   Consulted for molecular workflow and matrix-free organization only. No
   MOLGW or VOTCA executable was run during this implementation.
5. [PySCF user documentation](https://pyscf.org/user/tddft.html).
   Installed PySCF 2.9.0 supplies the HF/CIS unscreened-limit oracle, not a BSE
   oracle. Its version has no `pyscf.gw.bse`; the newer online BSE code was
   inspected during planning but is not the executed acceptance reference.

The production JAX BSE code is a new implementation of the stated equations.
No QuAcK, MOLGW, VOTCA or newer PySCF BSE source is vendored or executed by it.
The optional comparison script downloads pinned QuAcK sources to a temporary
cache and checks their SHA256 before compilation. Normal pytest uses small
saved numerical reference arrays and does not require network access or Fortran.

Agreement with a same-input static kernel is an implementation check. It does
not establish equality of different GW starting points, screening prescriptions,
basis sets, or dynamic/static approximations, nor physical accuracy against
FCI or experimental excitation energies.
